#### Chapter 1: The TCP/IP and OSI Networking Models
```
Two networking models: TCP/IP and OSI
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
Enterprise Network
Small Office Home Office (SOHO)
Protocol is a set of logical rules that devices must follow to communicate
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Layer 4
Internet Protocol (IP), Layer 3
International Business Machines (IBM)
IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), 1974, Layer 3
Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), Layer 2
International Standards Organization (ISO) - origin of OSI model
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) - origin of TCP/IP model (RFC 1122)
Request for Comments (RFC)
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Tim Berners-Lee
User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Layer 4
Dotted-Decimal Notation (DDN), e.g. 192.168.43.1
Point to Point (PPP) and Frame Releay, Layer 2
Frame, Layer 2
Packet, Layer 3 
Segment or Datagram, Layer 4
Lan Hub, Layer 1, copies signals to all ports (also repeaters, cables)
Lan Switch, Layer 2 Switch, copies frames (also WAP, modems)
Router, Layer 3, reframes packets
Layering benefits: Less complex, standard interfaces, easier to learn, easier to develop, multivendor interoperability, modular engineering
