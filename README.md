I think that I shall never see  
a graph more lovely than a tree.  
A tree whose crucial property  
is loop-free connectivity.  
A tree that must be sure to span  
so packets can reach every LAN.  
First, the root must be selected.  
By ID, it is elected.  
Least-cost paths from root are traced.  
In the tree, these paths are placed.  
A mesh is made by folks like me,  
then bridges find a spanning tree.
